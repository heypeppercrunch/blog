                <h1>Read Write Own: A PM&#39;s Take on Web3&#39;s Future</h1>
<p>Hey! I&#39;m a PM at AO Labs, and I just spent time with Chris Dixon&#39;s &quot;Read Write Own&quot;. Let me share what got me excited and how it&#39;s changing how we build.</p>
<h1>The Big Picture: Why Blockchain Matters</h1>
<h2>A New Kind of Network</h2>
<p>Blockchain does something we&#39;ve never seen before. It takes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The openness of protocols (like email and web)</li>
<li>The power of corporate networks (like Facebook)</li>
<li>And combines them in a way that actually works</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous protocols struggled because they couldn&#39;t fund development or reward creators. Blockchain fixes this with built-in incentives. This isn&#39;t just an upgrade - it&#39;s a new foundation for building.</p>
<h2>The Steel Revolution of Tech</h2>
<p>Dixon makes this cool comparison: Blockchain is like steel during the Industrial Revolution. Steel didn&#39;t just make buildings a bit stronger - it let us build skyscrapers and railways that were impossible before. </p>
<p>Similarly, blockchain isn&#39;t just making networks better. It&#39;s letting us build things we couldn&#39;t even imagine in Web2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networks that can&#39;t be shut down</li>
<li>Digital assets that users truly own</li>
<li>Apps that share value directly with users</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Big Tech Should Worry</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s an insight that stuck with me: While AI and VR play into big tech&#39;s strengths, blockchain is different. It threatens their control over networks and data. That&#39;s why startups have a real shot at building the next big things here.</p>
<h1>Building Different: Lessons for Builders</h1>
<h2>The Power of Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Dixon introduces &quot;composability&quot; - think of it like compound interest for software. Every new blockchain app becomes a building block that others can use. At AO Labs, we&#39;re seeing this firsthand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each new protocol multiplies what&#39;s possible</li>
<li>Developers can mix and match features freely</li>
<li>Innovation happens faster because we&#39;re all building on each other&#39;s work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking the Web2 Mold</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s a challenge we&#39;re tackling at AO Labs: Most Web3 apps are just copying Web2. Instagram ‚Üí Web3 Instagram. Twitter ‚Üí Web3 Twitter.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s like making a &quot;horseless carriage&quot; instead of reimagining transportation. What could social networks look like if we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let users truly own their social graphs?</li>
<li>Made content portable between apps?</li>
<li>Built reputation systems that work across platforms?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Economics Matter</h2>
<p>Building in Web3 is a new challenge. We need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Match Web2&#39;s ease of use</li>
<li>Get the token economics right</li>
<li>Create platforms others want to build on</li>
<li>Make decentralization actually matter to users</li>
</ul>
<p>At AO Labs, we&#39;re learning that these pieces have to work together. Great UX isn&#39;t enough if the economics don&#39;t work.</p>
<h2>Networks Change Everything</h2>
<p>Dixon points out something crucial: The killer app of the internet isn&#39;t information - it&#39;s networks. How information spreads matters more than the information itself.</p>
<p>This shapes how we build at AO Labs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We focus on making data flow between users and apps</li>
<li>We&#39;re building tools that let communities form naturally</li>
<li>We&#39;re creating ways for value to follow these connections</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Fun Part: Embracing the Unknown</h1>
<p>My favorite quote from the book hits close to home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Most likely, the best ideas either seem strange today or are yet unimagined. If you are used to participating in blockchain networks, you are used to people looking at you funny or thinking what you do is silly or a scam.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonates with our team at AO Labs. We&#39;re building stuff that sometimes seems weird to outsiders. But that&#39;s exactly where the opportunity is.</p>
<h1>Looking Forward</h1>
<p>We&#39;re in a unique moment. Just like early internet builders couldn&#39;t predict TikTok or Uber, we probably can&#39;t imagine the killer apps of Web3 yet.</p>
<p>At AO Labs, this excites us. We&#39;re not just trying to make existing stuff slightly better. We&#39;re trying to build things that couldn&#39;t exist before blockchain.</p>
<p>What &quot;weird&quot; ideas are you excited about? What becomes possible when users truly own their data and digital assets? Let&#39;s build something new together.</p>
