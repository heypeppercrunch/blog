# Building in Web3: 9 Key Areas for Crypto Product Management

After years of managing crypto products and nurturing vibrant communities, I've gained insights that can benefit fellow Product Managers in the Web3 space. Our role, while rooted in traditional product management principles, has expanded to encompass new dimensions unique to blockchain technology.

For those who have transitioned from traditional tech or grown alongside the crypto industry, you'll recognize that the core of our work remains the same. We're still focused on creating value for users, solving problems, and driving product adoption. However, the Web3 context adds new layers to consider in our day-to-day work.

## Introduction

I'd like to share nine key areas that I've found particularly important in my journey as a crypto PM. These insights stem from hands-on experience, successes, failures, and continuous learning in this dynamic field. They're not replacements for fundamental PM skills, but rather extensions that I've found crucial in the Web3 environment.

Each key point is structured in two parts:
1. A description of how crypto products uniquely operate in this area
2. Specific focuses and actions you, as a PM of a crypto product, should consider in response

## 1. Trust and Community as Foundation

**Crypto products:** Unlike traditional products, crypto products gain meaning and value only when a group of people collectively trust in their worth. It's this shared belief that forms the foundation of crypto products.

**PM focus:** Your job as a PM goes beyond just building features. Focus on building strong relationships with your user community. Work on making this group more solid, dense, and larger. Remember, in the crypto world, the strength of your community often determines the success of your product.

## 2. Community Engagement Beyond Feedback

**Crypto products:** In the Web3 space, the community's opinion isn't just nice-to-have feedback – it's critical to the product's success and evolution.

**PM focus:**
- Treat communication as a product in itself. It's not just about what you build, but how you talk about it
- For every feature or modification, plan not just the development but also how you'll communicate it to the community
- Think of product development and community communication as two sides of the same coin

## 3. Practical Community Engagement

**Crypto products:** In Web3, the community and the product are inseparable. They grow and evolve together.

**PM focus:**
- Make community sentiment a regular part of your product discussions
- Don't be a faceless PM - communicate directly with the community
- Show appreciation for individual community members
- Always be learning about effective community communication
- Get creative in addressing community concerns
- Be clear and accurate when addressing problems

## 4. User Investment in Crypto Products

**Crypto products:** Even when users aren't directly paying for features, they're investing time, effort, and often small amounts of cryptocurrency just to interact with your product.

**PM focus:** Always show respect for these investments. Whether it's time spent learning your platform or crypto spent on transactions, acknowledge the commitment users are making. This is especially important if you're dealing with NFTs or other digital assets.

## 5. Security and Trust

**Crypto products:** In the crypto world, users often invest significant sums into relatively new startups – something rarely seen in other industries. This is possible because of the transparency that blockchain technology provides.

**PM focus:**
- Take security extremely seriously
- Always think about what could go wrong
- Prepare thoroughly for testing
- Remember that users trust the transparency of blockchain, not blind faith in your team

## 6. Importance of Distribution

**Crypto products:** In the crypto world, how you distribute your product or tokens can make or break your project, regardless of how good your features are.

**PM focus:**
- Give distribution the same attention as feature development
- Communicate your reasoning clearly
- Ensure your distribution method is fair and well-explained

## 7. Interoperability in Web3

**Crypto products:** In the world of Web3, interoperability is a crucial characteristic. This means different products and services can work together seamlessly.

**PM focus:** Always think about how your product can integrate with others. Consider how to collaborate with other projects and make users' capital work more efficiently across different platforms.

## 8. Early Adopters in Crypto

**Crypto products:** The crypto space is full of early adopters – users who are always on the lookout for the next big thing, even if they're already using good services.

**PM focus:** Capitalize on this enthusiasm by providing clear visibility into your product roadmap. Show these potential users where you're headed, but be cautious about overpromising.

## 9. Early Stage of Web3 Market

**Crypto products:** It's important to understand that Web3 is still in its early stages. Unlike more established markets, there aren't clear winners or set ways of doing things yet.

**PM focus:**
- Learn to trust your intuition alongside data
- Spend time developing your understanding of the market
- Think big about how your work can create positive change

## Conclusion

Throughout my time as a PM in the crypto space, I've come to appreciate how our traditional role expands in subtle but important ways. While we're still focused on building features and optimizing user experiences, we also find ourselves more deeply involved in community building, establishing trust in new systems, and potentially influencing the direction of emerging technologies.

This expansion of our role presents both challenges and opportunities. Every decision we make can have implications not just for our products, but for our users and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Yet, this is also what makes our work so exciting and impactful.

Let's continue to learn from each other and push the boundaries of what's possible in Web3, all while staying grounded in the timeless principles of effective product management. Here's to building better products and stronger communities together.
