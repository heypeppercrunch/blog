                <h1>Why I Have Faith in Blockchain Becoming Mainstream</h1>
<h2>A Product Manager&#39;s Perspective</h2>
<p>As a product manager in the crypto space, I&#39;ve had a front-row seat to the rapid evolution of blockchain technology. Despite the ups and downs of the market, I remain convinced that blockchain is on a path to becoming mainstream. Here&#39;s why:</p>
<h2>1. The World is Becoming Borderless</h2>
<p>In our increasingly connected world, our actions are no longer confined by geographical boundaries. We&#39;re interacting with people from all corners of the globe, and crypto enables seamless transactions with anyone, anywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>Language barriers are dissolving thanks to instant translation tools</li>
<li>Economic interactions across borders are becoming more common and necessary</li>
<li>Crypto provides an elegant solution for exchanging value globally without the complexities of traditional international finance</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine easily collaborating on a project with someone in Africa and instantly sending them payment - that&#39;s the power of crypto.</p>
<h2>2. The Rise of AI and Non-Human Interactions</h2>
<p>As AI becomes more prevalent, our economic interactions may not always involve other humans. We might transact with AI agents or autonomous systems. In this scenario, what will serve as the currency?</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional fiat currencies might struggle to adapt to this new paradigm</li>
<li>Cryptocurrencies, designed for digital interactions, could be the perfect fit for human-AI economic exchanges</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. The Creator Economy is Booming</h2>
<p>The marginal cost of creation and execution is plummeting, thanks in part to AI. This trend is turning everyone into a potential creator, and blockchain technology aligns perfectly with creators&#39; needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creators are moving away from traditional company structures towards individual skill-based contributions and community-centric models</li>
<li>People are becoming accustomed to building their own value and directly profiting from it</li>
<li>Just look at how individuals build fan communities and monetize their content on platforms like Instagram and TikTok</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain provides the tools for creators to tokenize their work, engage with their community, and capture more of the value they create.</p>
<h2>4. The Democratization of Investment</h2>
<p>People derive value and satisfaction from owning and investing in things. Blockchain and crypto make this more accessible than ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>More people are investing in stocks and other assets than at any point in history</li>
<li>Crypto lowers the barriers to entry for investment, allowing anyone to participate in exciting new projects and potentially profit from their growth</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. The Power of Decentralized Information</h2>
<p>We&#39;re moving away from relying solely on information provided by central authorities. Instead, people are increasingly making decisions based on grassroots information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms like Polymarket allow people to bet on outcomes, creating prediction markets that can be more accurate than traditional forecasting methods</li>
<li>This decentralized approach to information aligns perfectly with blockchain&#39;s ethos</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. The Drive for Disintermediation</h2>
<p>People are becoming more comfortable with and desirous of direct peer-to-peer interactions, cutting out middlemen.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rallying cry isn&#39;t &quot;Get rid of the driver,&quot; it&#39;s &quot;Get rid of Uber&quot;</li>
<li>While platforms like Uber initially improved conditions for drivers compared to traditional taxi companies, as they become dominant, they often increase their take rates</li>
<li>Blockchain offers the potential for truly peer-to-peer services without a central authority taking a cut</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. The Eternal Desire to Make Money</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s face it: people like to make money, and this won&#39;t change in the next decade or even century.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto has invented numerous innovative ways to make money from creativity</li>
<li>Unlike traditional finance, crypto offers opportunities like yield farming, liquidity provision, and play-to-earn gaming that were previously unimaginable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a product manager in this space, I&#39;m excited by the potential of blockchain to reshape our economic interactions. While challenges remain, the alignment of blockchain technology with emerging trends in global connectivity, AI, the creator economy, and the desire for more direct and democratic economic participation gives me faith that blockchain will indeed become mainstream.</p>
<p>The journey won&#39;t be without its bumps, but as we continue to build and innovate, I believe we&#39;re creating a more open, efficient, and empowering financial future. And that&#39;s something worth having faith in.</p>
